I enjoy challenging problems that require the application of Mathematics via developing codes and algortihm to solve problems.
This repository is where I will be solving problems across a variety of websites with varying difficulty. While some problems might be easy, I will try to use best practice and proper documentation to build the habit of implementing coding best practice.

I also hope to use this repository to track my progress in getting better at solving problems and learning new concepts and techniques.

1. Project Euler
https://projecteuler.net/
A series of challenging mathematical problems that will require coding capabilities along with the mathematical insights to solve. 
Problems are categorised via a difficulty rating as a percentage. The file containing Project Euler questions will include the problem titles with their difficulty rating (DL), the description from the website and the code I used to solve the problem.

Answers are submitted on the website at which point if you are notified that the answer is correct, you can assume your code works.
There are 923 problems and my current count of solved problems is 0/923.
