I enjoy challenging problems that require the application of Mathematics via developing codes and algortihm to solve problems.
This repository is where I will be solving problems across a variety of websites with varying difficulty.
I also hope to use this repository to track my progress in getting better at solving problems and learning new concepts and techniques.
